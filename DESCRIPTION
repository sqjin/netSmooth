Description: A smaller version of netSmooth, with only the essentials! netSmooth is an R package for network smoothing of single cell RNA
    sequencing data. Using bio networks such as protein-protein interactions as
    priors for gene co-expression, netsmooth improves cell type identification
    from noisy, sparse scRNAseq data.
